description: Connect your AI coding assistant to Base documentation using Model Context Protocol for real-time access.
---

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard that lets AI assistants securely access external data sources. The Base MCP server connects your AI coding assistant directly to our documentation, giving it live access to search and retrieve the exact information you need in real time.

## Setup with Cursor

[Cursor](https://cursor.com/) is an AI-powered code editor built as a fork of VS Code with features like AI code completion and natural language editing.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open MCP settings">
    In Cursor, open **Settings** and navigate to **Tools & MCP**, then click **Add MCP Server**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Base docs server">
    In the `mcp.json` configuration file, add:

    ```json mcp.json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "base-docs": {
          "url": "https://docs.base.org/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and restart">
    Save the file and restart Cursor to apply the changes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start building">
    Your AI assistant can now access Base docs in real time. Try asking: "How do I deploy a smart contract on Base?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setup with Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) is an agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal and understands your codebase.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the Base docs MCP server">
    Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash Terminal
    claude mcp add --transport http base-docs https://docs.base.org/mcp
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify installation">
    Check that the server was added successfully:

    ```bash Terminal
    claude mcp list
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start building">
    Launch Claude Code and start asking questions. Try: "How do I deploy a smart contract on Base?"
  </Step>
</Steps>
