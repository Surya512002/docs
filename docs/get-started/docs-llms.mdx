description: Use llms.txt and llms-full.txt to give AI assistants access to Base documentation.
---

## Documentation index

Fetch the complete documentation index at: [https://docs.base.org/llms.txt](https://docs.base.org/llms.txt)

Use this file to discover all available pages before exploring further.

## Full documentation file

If your AI tool doesn't support MCP yet, you can use a static documentation file instead. This gives your AI assistant the entire Base documentation as one text file.

<Warning>
  The static `llms-full.txt` file is a snapshot and may not include the latest updates. Use [MCP](/get-started/docs-mcp) when possible for always-current docs.
</Warning>
